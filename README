Welcome To The Kings Quest Demo Readme File!


To play the KQ7 demo from DOS:

	King's Quest VII is a Hi-Res game
	It needs a VESA compatible video card.  You may have to
   run a VESA driver before running the game.  Check your video card's
   manuals if you have problems.  For your convenience, we've included
   a sub-directory full of VESA drivers; if your card is there, feel
   free to use it. 

   Change to the appropriate CD drive.
   Change your current directory to the subdirectory named KQ7DEMO.
   At the DOS prompt, type INSTALL and press <Enter>
   then follow the prompts in the install program.
   To run the demo, type KQ7DEMO from the subdirectory the demo
   was installed to.

To play from Windows:
   From the FILE menu select RUN. On the command line enter D:\KQ7DEMO\SETUP
   (use D: or whatever your CD drive is) and click OK. When the setup program
   is finished installing, an icon is provided by the setup program.  
   Just double click on the icon.  Please note: this should not be confused 
   with the setup procedure for the PQ4CD game.


Use the <Esc> key to quit.  If the demo is scrolling when you 
hit <Esc>, it won't quit until the scrolling is finished.

After the demo starts, you will be asked if you want to include
scrolling.  This option is given because there are substantial scrolling 
speedups in the works and presently it is slow on 386's.  It is expected 
the shipping version scrolling will be faster by a factor of five.
 

Memory:

Windows - This Demo requires 8 meg of ram to run.

Dos - If you need more memory, rerun the INSTALL program
for this demo and choose 'Make A Bootdisk.'
